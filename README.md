# Web-Scrapping-Project
Retrieving the list of police officers killed on duty

Objective: To obtain through Web Scrapping, the list of police officers killed on duty along with the respective information of the event.

Context.
The present project is part of my activities as a research assistant at Purdue University. Specifically, it was necessary to take the list of police officers killed in service between the years 1996 and 2021 along with the cause, the police department, state where the event occurred, and the day, year, and month in which the officer's death occurred. This list was then converted into an excel dataset. This information can be found at https://www.odmp.org/search/year/

Results
As a product of the activity, a CSV file was obtained. Two scripts are generated for data collection. One of them contains the algorithm used to perform Web Scrapping and another one contains the data processing through the Pandas library.

Conclusion
It is expected that the information collected will be used as input for the tutor's research projects. Additionally, the scripts will be input for future projects that have information sources in web pages.
